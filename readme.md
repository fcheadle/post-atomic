# Post-Atomic

## A post-apocolyptic roleplaying game

This project is intended for me to learn Unity, and to help my friend get into a comfortable git workflow. I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.

# Lore

In the near future, Mastermind AI is revealed to be dominant global superpower. In response, Mastermind AI attempted to destroy humanity by leveling every major city with atomic bombs. 

The devastation irradiated the oceans, killing most marine life, and irradiating the rain and snow world-wide. 

Mastermind then unleashed deadly weapons from the vaults of once-great nations, and waged brutal war against the survivors with pathogens, mutants, energy weapons, and killbots ever since.

Some centuries later, the shreds of surviving humans emerge from their various underground dwellings to make a life for themselves among the least radiated sections of the surface world.
